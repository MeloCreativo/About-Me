ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m Francisco Melo, a graphic designer and web layout coder from Argentina.

I've been working as a UX/UI designer for more than 3 years now and nowadays you can find me working at Devartis as a Jr. Web Layout Coder.

I'm very passionate about my job and I'm trying to get as much experience as possible from my colleagues.

As a Graphic & UX/UI Designer, I consider myself an advanced user of software such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Indesign, Figma, Sketch, and many more.

  And for the coding part, I'm also an experienced HTML, SASS, LESS & JS user.

So far you've learned a little about me. If you want to learn more, let's chat and work together :)
